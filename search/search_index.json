Autoscan integrates with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Google Drive to fetch changes in near real-time without relying on the file system. Wait, what happened to Plex Autoscan ? Well, Autoscan is a rewrite of the original Plex Autoscan written in the Go language. In addition, this rewrite introduces a more modular approach and should be easy to extend in the future. Introduction \u00b6 Autoscan is split into three distinct modules: Triggers Processor Targets Let's take a look at the journey of the path /tv/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv coming from Sonarr. Sonarr's path is translated to a path local to Autoscan. \\ /mnt/unionfs/Media/TV/Westworld/Season 1/s01e01.mkv The path is accessed by Autoscan to check whether it exists and adds it to the datastore. Autoscan's path is translated to a path local to Plex. \\ /data/TV/Season 1/s01e01.mkv This should be all that's needed to get you going. Good luck! Triggers \u00b6 Triggers are the 'input' of Autoscan. They translate incoming data into a common data format called the Scan. Autoscan supports two kinds of triggers: Daemon processes. These triggers run in the background and fetch resources based on a cron schedule or in real-time. \\ Bugs may still exist. Webhooks. These triggers expose HTTP handlers which can be added to the trigger's software. Each trigger consists of at least: A unique identifier: think of Drive IDs and HTTP routes. \\ Webhooks use /triggers/ + their name to uniquely identify themselves. Trigger-wide priority: higher priorities are processed sooner. \\ Defaults to 0. RegExp-based rewriting rules: translate a path given by the trigger to a path on the local file system. \\ If the paths are identical between the trigger and the local file system, then the rewrite field should be ignored. Daemons \u00b6 Daemons run in the background and continuously fetch new changes based on a cron expression . The following daemons are currently provided by Autoscan: Google Drive (Bernard) Inotify Webhooks \u00b6 Webhooks, also known as HTTPTriggers internally, process HTTP requests on their exposed endpoints. They should be tailor-made for the software they plan to support. Each instance of a webhook exposes a route which is added to Autoscan's main router. If one wants to configure a HTTPTrigger with multiple distinct configurations, then these configurations MUST provide a field called Name which uniquely identifies the trigger. The name field is then used to create the route: /triggers/:name . The following webhooks are currently provided by Autoscan: Sonarr Radarr Lidarr Manual Webhook \u00b6 Autoscan also supports a manual webhook for custom scripts or for software which is not supported by Autoscan directly. The manual endpoint is available at /triggers/manual . The manual endpoint accepts one or multiple directory paths as input and should be given one or multiple dir query parameters. Just like the other webhooks, the manual webhook is protected with basic authentication if the auth option is set in the config file of the user. URL template: POST /triggers/manual?dir=$path1&dir=$path2 The following curl command sends a request to Autoscan to scan the directories /test/one and /test/two : curl --request POST \\ --url 'http://localhost:3030/triggers/manual?dir=%2Ftest%2Fone&dir=%2Ftest%2Ftwo' \\ --header 'Authorization: Basic aGVsbG8gdGhlcmU6Z2VuZXJhbCBrZW5vYmk=' Note: You can visit /triggers/manual within a browser to manually submit requests Configuration \u00b6 A snippet of the config.yml file showcasing what is possible.

Optional: set username and password. Experimental support for more events \u00b6 Autoscan also supports the following events in the latest versions of Radarr and Sonarr: - Rename - On Movie Delete and On Series Delete - On Movie File Delete and On Episode File Delete We are not 100% sure whether these three events cover all the possible file system interactions. So for now, please do keep using Bernard or the Inotify trigger to fetch all scans. Processor \u00b6 Triggers pass the Scans they receive to the processor. The processor then saves the Scans to its datastore. The processor uses SQLite as its datastore, feel free to hack around! In a separate process, the processor selects Scans from the datastore. It will always group files belonging to the same folder together and it waits until all the files in that folder are older than the minimum-age , which defaults to 10 minutes. When all files are older than the minimum age, then the processor will call all the configured targets in parallel to request a folder scan. Anchor files \u00b6 To prevent the processor from calling targets when a remote mount is offline, you can define a list of so called anchor files . These anchor files do not have any special properties and often have no content. However, they can be used to check whether a file exists on the file system. If the file does not exist and you have not made any changes to the file, then it is certain that the remote mount must be offline or the software is having problems. When an anchor file is unavailable, the processor will halt its operations until the file is back online. We suggest you to use different anchor file names if you merge multiple remote mounts together with a tool such as UnionFS or MergerFS . Each remote mount MUST have its own anchor file and its own name for that anchor file. In addition, make sure to define the 'merged' path to the file and not the remote mount path. This helps check whether the union-software is working correctly as well. Minimum age \u00b6 Autoscan does not check whether scan requests received by triggers exist on the file system. Therefore, to make sure a file exists before it reaches the targets, you should set a minimum age. The minimum age delays the scan from being send to the targets after it has been added to the queue by a trigger. The default minimum age is set at 10 minutes to prevent common synchronisation issues. Customising the processor \u00b6 The processor allows you to set the minimum age of a Scan. In addition, you can also define a list of anchor files. A snippet of the config.yml file: # override the minimum age to 30 minutes: minimum-age : 30m # override the delay between processed scans: # defaults to 5 seconds scan-delay : 15s # override the interval scan stats are displayed: # defaults to 1 hour / 0s to disable scan-stats : 1m # set multiple anchor files anchors : - /mnt/unionfs/drive1.anchor - /mnt/unionfs/drive2.anchor The minimum-age , scan-delay and scan-stats fields should be given a string in the following format: 1s if the min-age should be set at 1 second. 5m if the min-age should be set at 5 minutes. 1m30s if the min-age should be set at 1 minute and 30 seconds. 1h if the min-age should be set at 1 hour. Please do not forget the s , m or h suffix, otherwise the time unit defaults to nanoseconds. Scan stats will print the following information at a configured interval: Scans processed Scans remaining Targets \u00b6 While collecting Scans is fun and all, they need to have a final destination. Targets are these final destinations and are given Scans from the processor, one batch at a time. Autoscan currently supports the following targets: Plex Emby Jellyfin Autoscan Plex \u00b6 Autoscan replaces Plex's default behaviour of updating the Plex library automatically. Therefore, it is advised to turn off Plex's Update my library automatically feature. You can setup one or multiple Plex targets in the config: targets : plex : - url : https://plex.domain.tld # URL of your Plex server token : XXXX # Plex API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Plex docker container (if applicable) There are a couple of things to take note of in the config: URL.

You can setup one or multiple Emby targets in the config: targets : emby : - url : https://emby.domain.tld # URL of your Emby server token : XXXX # Emby API Token rewrite : - from : /mnt/unionfs/Media/ # local file system to : /data/ # path accessible by the Emby docker container (if applicable) URL.

Put your spare hardware to use with Tdarr Nodes for Windows, Linux (including Linux arm) and macOS. Code in this repository is for Tdarr V1, Tdarr V2 is not open-source. Designed to work alongside applications like Sonarr/Radarr and built with the aim of modularisation, parallelisation and scalability, each library you add has its own transcode settings, filters and schedule. Workers can be fired up and closed down as necessary, and are split into 4 types - Transcode CPU/GPU and Health Check CPU/GPU. Worker limits can be managed by the scheduler as well as manually. For a desktop application with similar functionality please see HBBatchBeast .
